# Welcome to Intuit QuickBooks API

Our newest API utilizes the [GraphQL framework](https://graphql.org/) and makes developing focused solutions around specific accounting problems easier than ever.

The API offers several advantages over our existing [REST-based QuickBooks Online Accounting API](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/rest-api-features). In general, this new paradigm is more dynamic, requires fewer queries, and allows granular data scoping.

## Get Started

The below tracks can help you get started using Intuit's API:

- [Set up and start developing](./docs/getting-started)
- [Learn about about GraphQL](./docs/graphql-concepts)
- [Build apps around specific use cases](./docs/use-cases)

**Note**: Our GraphQL API is currently in alpha. Participation is by invite-only for select Intuit partners.
