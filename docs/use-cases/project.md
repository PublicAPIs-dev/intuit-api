## Project

The APIs related to the Project entity allow you to manage and track projects.
The Project API provides support for create, read, update, and delete operations.
You can also add transactions to your project by configuring the ID for the project while creating the transaction.

This page outlines - 
- The Create/Read operations for Projects.
  - The Create operation for Invoice (sales transaction) with Projects. 

Currently, we have added support to a few transactions so that you can configure a project ID. 
These include a few transactions like - 

- Supported sales Transactions for your customers -
    - Estimate
    - Invoice
    - Invoice payment
    - Sales Receipt
    - Refund Receipt
    - Credit Memo
   
- Supported purchase transactions for your vendors -     
    - Bill
    - Expense
    - Purchase order
