# Adopt Intuit API best practices

As you develop your app integration with QuickBooks, here are a few best practices for the API. Consider incorporating them in your app if you havenâ€™t already.



## Intuit API best practices


### Log frequently during development

Take the time to properly log your app development process. It saves time in the long-run. Logging every execution may impact app performance, so prioritize what matters most.

<tr>
<td><strong>Tip</strong>: Always <a href="../../faq/error-handling/">log the value of the <strong>intuit_tid</strong> field</a> in the server response. It will help our support team quickly find and address any reported issues.
</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Learn about API throttling

- 500 requests per minute, per realm ID
- 10 concurrent requests per realm ID and app.

**Note**: The above throttling limits are subject to change in the future. 



### Keep up with the latest version of Intuit API

**Note**: We'll have more details around versioning in the future.
